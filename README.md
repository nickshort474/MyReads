# MyReads Project

Library app by Nick Short.

This is an app for maintaining and displaying a record of books that a user is either reading, wants to read or has already ready read. Each category of books has its own self. For each book there is a drop down box which allows the user to move books from shelf to shelf.
There is also a search functionality that allows users to search a database and select a book to add to a shelf on their library.

The app can be installed by running 'npm install' and then once the installation has finished the app can be run using 'npm start'
